Beeline
================
A simple QGIS plugin that creates lines along great circles to connect a set of input points. 
Example:

Project home and bug tracker: https://github.com/pgipper/Beeline

Important notes on input data:

* accepts only WGS 84
* ignores invalid geometries
* works well for up to a few hundred input points (save your project and edits!)
